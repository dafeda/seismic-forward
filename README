0. GitHub
---------

To be able to check out the repository to your file system, you must have
generated a personal access token in GitHub. This token is used in place
of your personal password when accessing the repo

  https://github.com/settings/tokens

To have Git remember the credentials for you, do this

  $ git config --global credential.helper cache                  # (activate memory cache)
  $ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600' # (timeout in seconds)


1. Prerequisites
----------------

  Boost     -> version 1.65.1 is included under 3rd-party
               NB! If another version of Boost is installed in the operating
               system cmake may become confused and stop working.

  Intel MKL -> Must be installed

               (PAAL: Compilers and libraries for version 2016.2.181 installed under /opt/software/intel)


2. To make an executable using CLion or another IDE
---------------------------------------------------

Go to the directory containing the Geo2Seis git repository

  $ clion CMakeLists.txt


3. To make an executable using cmake
------------------------------------

Go to the directory above the directory containing the Geo2Seis git repository

  $ cd dir-above-Geo2Seis

Make directory where you want the project and executable to be build

  $ mkdir my-proj-dir

Go to this directory and run run_cmake.sh

  $ cd my-proj-dir
  $ ../Geo2Seis/run_cmake.sh


4. Run the tests
----------------

To run all tests do

  $ ../Geo2Seis/TestScript.pl

To run a single test do

  $ ../Geo2Seis/TestScript.pl case=1

NBNB! If more than one angle is involved, I think that results for the first
angle only is checked. This is the way NRLib currently works.
