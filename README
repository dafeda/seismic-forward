0. Prerequisites
----------------

 Boost     -> version 1.65.1 is included under 3rd-party
              NB! If another version of Boost is installed in the operating system cmake may become confused and stop working.

 Flens     -> version ??? is included under 3rd-party

 Intel MKL -> Must be installed

              PAAL: Compilers and libraries for version 2016.2.181 installed under /opt/software/intel


1. To make an executable using CLion or another IDE
---------------------------------------------------

Go to the directory containing the Geo2Seis git repository

  $ clion CMakeLists.txt


2. To make an executable using cmake
------------------------------------

Go to the directory above the directory containing the Geo2Seis git repository

  $ cd dir-above-Geo2Seis

Make directory where you want the project and executable to be build

  $ mkdir my-proj-dir

Go to this directory and run run_cmake.sh

  $ cd my-proj-dir
  $ ../Geo2Seis/run_cmake.sh


3. Run the tests
----------------

To run all tests do

  $ ../Geo2Seis/TestScript.pl

To run a single test do

  $ ../Geo2Seis/TestScript.pl case=1

NBNB! If more than one angle is involved, I think that results for the first
angle only is checked. This is the way NRLib currently works.
