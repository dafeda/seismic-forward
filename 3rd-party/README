To get boost to compile, there must be a link to the boost include files in
this directory. Typically these fiels are stored in /usr/include/boost.
Therefore you need to do a:

$ ln -s /usr/include/boost boost

If boost is not installed on the machine and cannot be installed, the include
files can be downloaded from
